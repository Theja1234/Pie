Hello, today we are going to make the most amazing apple pie ever. The best pie you have tasted in your entire life!! Let's start thee show!!!!!

Place a saucepan over medium heat on a stove. In the saucepan, put 8 unsalted teaspoons of unsalted butter. After it is melted, put in 3 teaspoons of flour and let it simmer for a minute whisking constantly. 

Next, put in 1/4 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar, then after it starts boiling reduce the heat and continue simmering for about 3 minutes stirring constantly. This is how we make the sauce to our apple pie.... it is also our secret ingredient to the pie....

When it is done, it will have a sauce consistency, then turn off the stove and let the sauce cool down.
Now let's prep our apples. You can use any fruit you want but I am using apples.

You need 5 to 6 apples for the pie. Peel all of your apples and take out the cores. After the apples are peeled and the core is taken out, cut all of the apples into thin slices and put them into a big bowl to mix something else....

Put in some cinnamon and stir the apples to coat the apples with cinnamon. Next add all of the sauce that we made earlier and make sure you get everything in there. Stir the sauce with the apples to coat the apples with the sauce.

Now set aside your big mixing bowl, it is time to make pie crust....


In the bowl of a food processor, combine 2 and a half cups of flour, 1/2 tablespoon of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt. Pulse those together to combine. Now you'll need half a pound of unsalted cold butter, straight from the fridge. Dice the butter into small pieces, then put it into the food processor. Pulse the mixture together until coarse crumbs form, with some pea-sized pieces, then stop mixing. It should be a powder consistency at this point. Now add exactly 6 tablespoons of ice water, then pulse just until moist clumps or small balls form. To test if you've added enough water, press some of the dough between your fingertips and it should stick together. If you over mix or add too much water the dough will be sticky and difficult to roll out. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and pull it together quickly with your hands. Do not knead the dough at this point, just pull it together.
Now divide it in half and flatten to form 2 equal discs. Wrap each disc in a sheet of plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator. You have to chill it for atleast an hour, then you can use it for the apple pie.

Now back to the main recipe....

After an hour, take out your pie dough and put it on a work surface. Before you put it down just sprinkle the work surface with some flour and roll out your first pie crust. Roll that first crust to about a 12 inch diameter circle. If you find the dough sticking to your rolling pin, sprinkle on just a little more flour. The easiest way to transfer this into the pie pan is to wrap it around your rolling pin gently and use a food scraper or a knife to loosen the dough in case it get's stuck to the surface.

Now simply unwrap it into a clean pie plate. Mold that gently into the plate and you should have a little bit of dough hanging over the edges. Add all of the apple mixture mounting it slightly in the center. Be careful to not get the filling on the edges of the dough which will make it difficult to seal.

Set that aside, then roll the second crust on a floured surface, but this time just to about an 11 inch round circle. I found that if you push the edges in, it'll roll into a much more even circle, which is important because we're going to be making strips out of this for the lattice topping.

Using a knife, cut 10 even thickness strips. Making a lattice topping is easier than you think. Take one of the long strips from the center and place it across the middle of your pie. The first five strips should be in one direction across your pie with the longer strips in the center and the shorter ones towards the edges. Peel back the second and fourth strips and place one large strip down the center. Now peel back the alternating strips and add another strip of dough. Continue doing this on the right and then the left until all of your lattice is complete.

Tuck the excess pie dough into the pan around the edges. Next beat together one egg and a tablespoon of sugar and brush that egg wash generously over all of the surface of the dough.

Transfer that to the center of a preheated oven and bake at 425 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes. Without opening the door, reduce the heat to 350 degrees fahrenheit and continue baking another 45 minutes or until the apples are soft and the filling is bubbling through the vents at the top.

After it is done, take it out of the oven and let it cool for about 1 hour. 

After it is rested for an hour, there is the last and biggest step of all time....

TO EATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Enjoy, see you next time.....
